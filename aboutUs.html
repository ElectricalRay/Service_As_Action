                Hello! And thank you for visiting our website <b>Service As Action</b>! We are a group of students currently enrolled at Centennial highschool.
                We are eager to put our current knowledge to the test, as well as further increase our abilities, and attempted to create a website ourselves!
                Together we came together to creating a webite whose purpose is to show upcoming <b>Community Service Events</b> for students in Cen10, 
                who are in need of service hours. We hope that this website will be of use to those who need it, and we have goals of expanding this website 
                if it's a big hit.
            </p>
